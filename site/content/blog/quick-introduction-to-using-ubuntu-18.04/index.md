## Super Key

The Super key is the same key as the Windows key on a Windows keyboard. Pressing it brings up the Activities Overview.


## Activities Overview

So you pressed the Super key and and are looking at the Activities Overview. In it you can see the currently open windows and the Workspaces list (see below).

I use the Activities Overview for access to the Search Bar (see below) which I use constantly and the Workspaces List which I use occasionally.

## Search Bar

Speaking of the Search Bar, it is the fastest way of launching applications as well as finding ....   . Just start typing say 'fire'.

The top section of the search results shows Firefox was found as an installed application. The small lighted orange dash at the bottom of the Firefox logo shows that I have one Firefox window open.

The next section is files found that contain 'fire' and the bottom section is software available to install that have 'fire' in their name or description (although I'm not sure how Kdenlive got in there).

## The Dash

The Dash appears on the left side of the primary monitor. You can add your favorite apps here and launch them, as well as see which apps are running and how many Windows open for each app.

Since I always launch application via the Search Bar, my preference for using the Dash is to remove all 'favorites' so it only shows running applications and the number of windows per application. I can't remember the last time I clicked on it.
