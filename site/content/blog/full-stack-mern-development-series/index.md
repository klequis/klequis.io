title: Full-Stack MERN Development
---

Last spring I started writing a book about full-stack MERN development. I made a great deal of progress but then other priorities took over and progress on the book has been slow. I have since decided to work on it in small chunks and post them as articles on [my blog](https://klequis.io).

The genesis of the book comes from the two-hundred or so people I met from holding 177 [TriValley Coders](http://www.trivalleycoders.org/) meetings over the past three years. During this time I met new and experienced software developers seeking to add new skills in order to find a new, better or first software developer job.

Often, people had learned a lot about one or more subjects but they often had two difficulties: 1) starting a project from scratch & 2) putting all the moving pieces together into a deployable application.

The book intends to address these two difficulties. As a result it is broad in scope and very 'how to' focused. While there are lots of tidbits for beginners and detailed instructions on how to accomplish each task, the book/articles are aimed at developers who already know JavaScript, HTML, CSS & a little React.

Below is the current outline with links to articles already published.
