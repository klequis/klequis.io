A somewhat whimsical post on being a software developer and not to be confused with becoming one.

## Close your email and social accounts

If you think your email, Twitter, Facebook, etc are not distracting you and lowering your abiltiy to get the job done you aren't correct.

## Read the doc

For any system, say Gatsby.js which this blog is made with, start at the beginning of the documentation and read to the end. You will never know how much time you saved. The only way to know is to not read until you have wasted time trying to fix/do stuff that is already discussed in the doc.

## Never give-up

Never give-up. Walk away, talk to a collegue, get a good night's sleep and try again tomorrow.

## Don't get discouraged

See 'Never give-up'


## Ask for help

Give it a try on your own. Do some research. Setup scenarios to test you theory (guesses?) but don't wait too long before asking for help.

## Back-up your data

Nothing funny here. In 10 years of managing software developers no one has ever come to me and said they lost there work. But I always had my response ready for the day they did. "You are fired." Hum..., in reality I valued the people I worked with too much to do that, but feeling would be there.

How about, "I'm really sorry, I know our deadline for the biggest project the team has ever done is next week but I just lost 5 days of work". That might do it.


... and use it

## Setup automatic backups

There are a number of ways to do this. I use rsync to a second hard drive.


## Learn Git

## Get a SSD
- Maybe most people have on now but if you don't your wasting time. As a software developer, you don't need a very big one. You only need enough space for your OS and whatever your currently working on.

## Follow the leader(s)

Do what your team decides until you are the leader. Once your the leader work to build concensus. You can't really tell smart ambitious people what to do. They won't follow.

## Don't watch software install

If your job is to write software installs or you are new to computers you are exempt from this. Otherwise, start the install and walk away. Get a glass of water or do a short stretch.

## Learn about ergonomics

The time to do this is when you are young and healty. Once your back or fingers start to hurt it's an uphill battle. Wait too long and you'll lose.

## Get an ergonomic keybard

I was tempted to put pictures of keyboards that are called 'Ergonimic' but they decided against disparaging any given product. Just google 'ergonomic keyboard'. What comes-up first is ergonimic in name only. Some of them are outrightly bad for you. Here is an example of an truly ergonimic keyboard.

The Kinesis Advantage has saved three careers that I personally know of. One of them is mine. I know, it look wierd, but it only took me 3 weeks of using it 15 - 20 minutes a day to become productive on it. I have bee happily typing away on it every day for the past 11 years.

## Learn keyboard shortcuts

It takes time and effort to lear shortcuts but pays in productivity. Try learning one frequently used on each week for say 20 weeks. You'll work like a pro.

## Type softly and somewhat slowly

Your fingers won't last forever and for some people, not long at all. Besides, software development is mostly thinking and planning. Typing fast won't get you much other than mistakes.

Carpenters should measure twice and cut once. Programmers should think twice (or more) and type once.

## Take my advice

Some of the above I am very consistent on. Other things a little less so. But never give-up.
